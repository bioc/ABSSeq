1.34.1 (2018-06-28)
+ Updating! Extend aFold to paired samples

1.32.2 (2017-12-18)
+ Updating! Refine qtotal (R funtion: qtotalNormalized)

1.30.1 (2017-07-18)
+ Updating! Adapt aFold model for complex design with linear model (R funtion: ABSSeqlm)

1.30.1 (2017-06-02)
+ Updating! Introduce a new approach for normalization as qtotal (R funtion: qtotalNormalized)
+ aFold now moderates fold changes upon overall dispersion and gene-specific dispersion

1.11.0 (2017-02-14)

1.5.1 (2015-08-24)
+ This is the second version of ABSSeq.
1) Use NB distribution insead of GP to model the counts difference between conditions
2) Introduce an efficient outlier detection method: moderated MAD
3) Introduce penalty for dispersion estimation
4) Provide moderation of log2 fold-change at expression level and gene-specific dispersion
